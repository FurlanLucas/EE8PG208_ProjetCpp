We address the problem of real-time obstacle avoidance on low-friction road surfaces using spatial Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). We use a nonlinear fourwheel vehicle dynamics model that includes load transfer. To overcome the computational difficulties we propose to use the ACADO Code Generation tool which generates NMPC algorithms based on the real-time iteration scheme for dynamic optimization. The exported plain C code is tailored to the model dynamics, resulting in faster run-times in effort for real-time feasibility. The advantages of the proposed method are shown through simulation.
